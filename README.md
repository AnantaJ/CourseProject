**Objectives:**

•	To develop a simple yet effective system to detect drowsiness of vehicle drivers and alert them.

•	To explore the use of Microcontrollers and apply skills learned through the course.

•	To analyze the working of the circuit and its effectiveness and propose improvements.


**Results:**

The drowsiness detection system, utilizing an IR reflective sensor mounted on wearable goggles, effectively detected prolonged eye closure and triggered timely alerts via a buzzer. It consistently identified closures exceeding the 3-second threshold during testing. The inclusion of a potentiometer allowed for easy calibration of sensor sensitivity based on individual user characteristics and environmental conditions.
The system performed reliably in controlled indoor settings, though its accuracy was affected in high ambient light environments, highlighting the IR sensor’s sensitivity to external interference. Proper sensor alignment and positioning were also essential for consistent detection.
Overall, the prototype demonstrated that a simple, low-cost IR-based solution can provide effective basic drowsiness detection without relying on complex image processing. The results support its potential use in driver safety applications and as a foundation for further development in wearable fatigue-monitoring systems.
